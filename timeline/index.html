The work imagines a future shaped by accelerating climate catastrophe and water scarcity, where corporations step in to provide housing through prefabricated shelters tied directly to food production and labor contracts. Exhibited as a large-format presentation board and later adapted as an augmented reality installation, the project won First Prize (Student Choice) at Critical Mass that year, positioning it between architectural proposal, narrative fiction, and propaganda artifact.\n\nThe reading of the work reflects the moment of its making. At the time, speculative design culture often produced exaggerated extremes as a form of safe estrangement, using implausibility to open critical distance. The Austere inverted this conceit: instead of hyperbole, it grounded itself in the plausible, reframing an extreme condition—collapse of water systems, corporate housing provision, labor serfdom—not as outlandish but as an almost logical extension of existing trends. The effect was unsettling: the imagery, from homestead-style prefabs to Wyeth-inspired fields, rendered austerity not futuristic but imminent.\n\nLooking back from 2025, the project reads as tied to the optimism and anxieties of its context. At that moment, the gig economy and corporate urban visions—Katerra, WeWork, Sidewalk Labs—were still seen as possible bulwarks against systemic collapse. The Austere took those trajectories to their limit, presenting them as survival infrastructure. In hindsight, as many of those corporate futures have faltered and private equity’s financialization of existing housing has become the dominant threat, the project stands less as prediction and more as a record of how speculative design can mirror its moment: exaggerating some dangers while making others visible in ways that, only later, prove prescient.","thumbnail_override":"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/static/thumbs/d4a1b0c09a1b4df381d769aa45266217.jpg","media_dimensions":{"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/austere/c__1_poster1.jpg":{"width":3976,"height":2012},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/austere/c__2_poster2.jpg":{"width":3976,"height":2012},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/austere/c__3_photo-1.png":{"width":1472,"height":704},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/austere/c__4_Midterm_10_12_-_Video_Presentation.webm":{"width":720,"height":406},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/static/thumbs/d4a1b0c09a1b4df381d769aa45266217.jpg":{"width":400,"height":202}},"file_paths":["https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/austere/c__1_poster1.jpg","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/austere/c__2_poster2.jpg","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/austere/c__3_photo-1.png","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/austere/c__4_Midterm_10_12_-_Video_Presentation.webm"],"recommended_ids":["recoveringurbanmemory","trainhouse","guchibytes","timelineatlas"]},{"title":"DM_Fazole","year":"2011","season":"","theme":"junk","tags":"modding, level design","id":"fazole","locked":false,"content":"https://gamebanana.com/mods/62197","description":"I fell in love with HL2DM, a niche first person shooter.

This detailed reconstruction functions as a spatial information model, where visitors navigate the architecture to explore memories, photographs, and media anchored directly to the 3D space. To house the installation, I designed and fabricated a bespoke, jet-age wooden console containing a touchscreen for navigation and a mirrored short-throw projection system for an immersive display. For visitors to contribute their own stories, I engineered a unique recording interface by embedding a robust, serial-based computer into a period landline phone, allowing them to record testimonials directly into the virtual archive. Presented by The Cyprus Institute, this installation is a core feature of a multi-year exhibition at the Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation.

I was also responsible for creating the event's graphic identity, and designing the official <a href='https://spacenature.web.illinois.edu/' target='_blank'>website</a>. During the symposium, held on February 14, 2025, I presented an early draft of my research paper, 'The Interpretive Nature of Space: Generative Ambiguity in Heritage Visualization'. <br><br><h1>Abstract</h3> In architectural representation, the tension between objectivity and ambiguity creates fertile ground for interpretive engagement. Yet contemporary digital visualization practices increasingly prioritize photorealism—a pursuit that, as Lefebvre cautions, risks reducing the multidimensionality of lived space to a superficial spectacle. Drawing on research conducted at Cyprus's Virtual Environments Laboratory, this paper contends that the nature of space emerges not through visual mimesis but through the generative potential of representational ambiguity. Such an approach aligns virtual reconstructions with the deeper intellectual and cultural aims of the Digital Humanities. <br>The Nicosia International Airport (1968), abandoned in Cyprus's UN buffer zone since 1974, exemplifies the interpretive challenges of modern architectural heritage. Here, meaning is negotiated between design intent, built form, and lived experience. More than a modernist relic of Cyprus's post-colonial aspirations, the site's abrupt abandonment transformed it into a time capsule of what de Certeau terms ‘spatial practices’: public terraces and amenities overlooking the tarmac once fostered forms of social life unimaginable in today's airports. With these practices now confined to living memory, there is an urgent need for methodologies that integrate experiential knowledge with conventional documentation.<br>To address this gap, we developed an innovative approach to heritage visualization through a year-long museum installation featuring a virtual reconstruction of the airport set in 1969. By embedding carefully designed 'interpretation gaps'—strategic ambiguities in the visualization—we created a system that invites visitors to actively bridge these gaps through their contributions: memories, media, and historical knowledge. In this way, the virtual environment becomes both a research instrument and a conduit for collective storytelling, supporting rather than supplanting the social practices that sustain collective memory.","thumbnail_override":"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/static/thumbs/804a43d479a53b29aa870b8189eb4239.jpg","media_dimensions":{"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/spacenature/c_Screenshot_2025-07-27_at_7_02_07_PM.png":{"width":1216,"height":1614},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/static/thumbs/804a43d479a53b29aa870b8189eb4239.jpg":{"width":301,"height":400}},"file_paths":["https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/spacenature/c_Screenshot_2025-07-27_at_7_02_07_PM.png"],"recommended_ids":["dariah25","nicairport","uniteposter","metaframing"]},{"title":"Quantum Itineraries Live Visuals","year":"2024","season":"fall","theme":"junk","tags":"data viz, tool, exhibition, live performance, video, art, design, cyprus institute","id":"qbicon","locked":false,"content":"","description":"I built a suite of tools and visualizations in Unity for live-generated 3D visuals for the <a href='https://quantum.itineraries.itabora.space/' target='_blank'>Quantum Itineraries</a> music performances.

This detailed reconstruction functions as a spatial information model, where visitors navigate the architecture to explore memories, photographs, and media anchored directly to the 3D space. To house the installation, I designed and fabricated a bespoke, jet-age wooden console containing a touchscreen for navigation and a mirrored short-throw projection system for an immersive display. For visitors to contribute their own stories, I engineered a unique recording interface by embedding a robust, serial-based computer into a period landline phone, allowing them to record testimonials directly into the virtual archive. Presented by The Cyprus Institute, this installation is a core feature of a multi-year exhibition at the Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation.

I was also responsible for creating the event's graphic identity, and designing the official <a href='https://spacenature.web.illinois.edu/' target='_blank'>website</a>. During the symposium, held on February 14, 2025, I presented an early draft of my research paper, 'The Interpretive Nature of Space: Generative Ambiguity in Heritage Visualization'. <br><br><h1>Abstract</h3> In architectural representation, the tension between objectivity and ambiguity creates fertile ground for interpretive engagement. Yet contemporary digital visualization practices increasingly prioritize photorealism—a pursuit that, as Lefebvre cautions, risks reducing the multidimensionality of lived space to a superficial spectacle. Drawing on research conducted at Cyprus's Virtual Environments Laboratory, this paper contends that the nature of space emerges not through visual mimesis but through the generative potential of representational ambiguity. Such an approach aligns virtual reconstructions with the deeper intellectual and cultural aims of the Digital Humanities. <br>The Nicosia International Airport (1968), abandoned in Cyprus's UN buffer zone since 1974, exemplifies the interpretive challenges of modern architectural heritage. Here, meaning is negotiated between design intent, built form, and lived experience. More than a modernist relic of Cyprus's post-colonial aspirations, the site's abrupt abandonment transformed it into a time capsule of what de Certeau terms ‘spatial practices’: public terraces and amenities overlooking the tarmac once fostered forms of social life unimaginable in today's airports. With these practices now confined to living memory, there is an urgent need for methodologies that integrate experiential knowledge with conventional documentation.<br>To address this gap, we developed an innovative approach to heritage visualization through a year-long museum installation featuring a virtual reconstruction of the airport set in 1969. By embedding carefully designed 'interpretation gaps'—strategic ambiguities in the visualization—we created a system that invites visitors to actively bridge these gaps through their contributions: memories, media, and historical knowledge. In this way, the virtual environment becomes both a research instrument and a conduit for collective storytelling, supporting rather than supplanting the social practices that sustain collective memory.","thumbnail_override":"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/static/thumbs/804a43d479a53b29aa870b8189eb4239.jpg","media_dimensions":{"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/spacenature/c_Screenshot_2025-07-27_at_7_02_07_PM.png":{"width":1216,"height":1614},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/static/thumbs/804a43d479a53b29aa870b8189eb4239.jpg":{"width":301,"height":400}},"file_paths":["https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/spacenature/c_Screenshot_2025-07-27_at_7_02_07_PM.png"],"recommended_ids":["dariah25","nicairport","uniteposter","metaframing"]},{"title":"Paphos Gate: Nicosia","year":"2016","season":"winter","end_year":"2024","theme":"blog","tags":"research, cyprus institute, architecture, design, heritage, 3d capture, VR, data-driven design","id":"paphosgate","locked":false,"content":"","description":"For this decade-long urban archaeology project, I served as a research assistant, focusing on virtual representation and data-driven design.

Stephen Cartwright is renowned for his innovative work, where he meticulously logs personal data over decades and then crafts this information into acrylic sculptures. These intricate pieces exhibit spatial-temporal patterns, providing a visual representation of a person's life and experiences in a uniquely tangible form. However, for this particular project, we utilized AR to surpass the limitations of his traditional manufacturing techniques. We aimed to visualize datasets of a complexity that would be virtually impossible to depict through physical sculptures.

The work imagines a future shaped by accelerating climate catastrophe and water scarcity, where corporations step in to provide housing through prefabricated shelters tied directly to food production and labor contracts. Exhibited as a large-format presentation board and later adapted as an augmented reality installation, the project won First Prize (Student Choice) at Critical Mass that year, positioning it between architectural proposal, narrative fiction, and propaganda artifact.\n\nThe reading of the work reflects the moment of its making. At the time, speculative design culture often produced exaggerated extremes as a form of safe estrangement, using implausibility to open critical distance. The Austere inverted this conceit: instead of hyperbole, it grounded itself in the plausible, reframing an extreme condition—collapse of water systems, corporate housing provision, labor serfdom—not as outlandish but as an almost logical extension of existing trends. The effect was unsettling: the imagery, from homestead-style prefabs to Wyeth-inspired fields, rendered austerity not futuristic but imminent.\n\nLooking back from 2025, the project reads as tied to the optimism and anxieties of its context. At that moment, the gig economy and corporate urban visions—Katerra, WeWork, Sidewalk Labs—were still seen as possible bulwarks against systemic collapse. The Austere took those trajectories to their limit, presenting them as survival infrastructure. In hindsight, as many of those corporate futures have faltered and private equity’s financialization of existing housing has become the dominant threat, the project stands less as prediction and more as a record of how speculative design can mirror its moment: exaggerating some dangers while making others visible in ways that, only later, prove prescient.","thumbnail_override":"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/static/thumbs/d4a1b0c09a1b4df381d769aa45266217.jpg","media_dimensions":{"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/austere/c__1_poster1.jpg":{"width":3976,"height":2012},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/austere/c__2_poster2.jpg":{"width":3976,"height":2012},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/austere/c__3_photo-1.png":{"width":1472,"height":704},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/austere/c__4_Midterm_10_12_-_Video_Presentation.webm":{"width":720,"height":406},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/static/thumbs/d4a1b0c09a1b4df381d769aa45266217.jpg":{"width":400,"height":202}},"file_paths":["https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/austere/c__1_poster1.jpg","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/austere/c__2_poster2.jpg","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/austere/c__3_photo-1.png","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/austere/c__4_Midterm_10_12_-_Video_Presentation.webm"],"recommended_ids":["recoveringurbanmemory","trainhouse","guchibytes","timelineatlas"]},{"title":"12 Miles a Year","year":"2018","season":"spring","theme":"blog","tags":"architecture, competition, design, archon studio","id":"trainhouse","locked":false,"content":"","description":"My winning entry for the Archon Studio of 2018, with the supervision of Olsen-Kundig Studio and professor Carl Lewis, drew inspiration from the post-industrial landscapes of the Midwest, particularly those of early nuclear research and energy production. Dresden Generating Station—the first privately financed nuclear power plant in the U.S. and a keystone of postwar energy optimism—sits within a landscape where rail lines, river corridors, and prairie converge. This terrain carries the layered histories of industry, energy, and abandonment. By re-inhabiting its disused rail lines, the project reclaims infrastructure not for transit or commerce but for reflection and habitation, transforming the residues of industry into a framework for living.\n\nRather than treating movement as speed or efficiency, the project reframes locomotion as a slow inhabitation of landscape. Its propulsion system borrows from the mechanics of a grandfather clock, scaled up into a pendulum, counterweights, and a 1.5-meter winding wheel. Each day, residents wind the mechanism to power the ultra-slow drive, where a heavy steel “foot” presses against the ground to move the house forward.\n\nBuilt on the reclaimed steel frame of boxcars, the house unfolds as a linear sequence—private quarters, dining, power, and communal spaces—that extend dwelling into a year-long passage across prairie, rivers, marshland, and ruins. In place of the forward thrust of rail or the concentrated energy of nuclear power, the project proposes a cyclical, patient mode of inhabiting the Anthropocene landscape. The house becomes an instrument for reading its environment slowly and deliberately, reframing abandoned infrastructure as a stage for observation, ritual, and renewed attachment to place.","thumbnail_override":"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/static/thumbs/f7ca0304d7bad6a75a162746a99820bb.jpg","media_dimensions":{"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/1_Artboard20copy10bb2x-100.jpg":{"width":2442,"height":2443},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/2_Artboard20bb2x-100.jpg":{"width":2442,"height":2443},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/3_GooglePortfolio24.jpg":{"width":2100,"height":2100},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/4_Artboard20copy6bb2x-100.jpg":{"width":2442,"height":2443},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/5_Artboard20copy5bb2x-100.jpg":{"width":2442,"height":2443},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/6_Artboard20copybb2x-100.jpg":{"width":2442,"height":2443},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/7_Artboard20copy2bb2x-100.jpg":{"width":2442,"height":2443},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/7_Artboard20copy4bb2x-100.jpg":{"width":2442,"height":2442},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/8_Artboard20copy3bb2x-100.jpg":{"width":2442,"height":2442},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/c__8_map.jpg":{"width":4000,"height":2415},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/c__8_midterm.jpg":{"width":4000,"height":4000},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/8_route.jpg":{"width":3960,"height":1150},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/c__9_1.png":{"width":1024,"height":1024},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/c__9_2.png":{"width":1024,"height":1024},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/c__9_3.png":{"width":1024,"height":1024},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/c__9_4.png":{"width":1024,"height":1024},"https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/static/thumbs/f7ca0304d7bad6a75a162746a99820bb.jpg":{"width":400,"height":400}},"file_paths":["https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/1_Artboard20copy10bb2x-100.jpg","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/2_Artboard20bb2x-100.jpg","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/3_GooglePortfolio24.jpg","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/4_Artboard20copy6bb2x-100.jpg","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/5_Artboard20copy5bb2x-100.jpg","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/6_Artboard20copybb2x-100.jpg","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/7_Artboard20copy2bb2x-100.jpg","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/7_Artboard20copy4bb2x-100.jpg","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/8_Artboard20copy3bb2x-100.jpg","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/c__8_map.jpg","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/c__8_midterm.jpg","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/8_route.jpg","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/c__9_1.png","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/c__9_2.png","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/c__9_3.png","https://colterwehmeier.github.io/portfolio/entries/blog/trainhouse/c__9_4.png"],"recommended_ids":["recoveringurbanmemory","austere","archonprize2018","bench"]},{"title":"Bezeliness Intensifies","year":"2018","season":"fall","theme":"blog","tags":"exhibition, art, design, new-media, 3d printing, furniture, fabrication, installation","id":"bezeliness","locked":false,"content":"","description":"This art and research project studies the aesthetics of frames and bezels through the use of space-filling curves, packing algorithms, and reaction-diffusion simulations.
