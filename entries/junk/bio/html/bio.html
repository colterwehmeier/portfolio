<!-- <p>Transatlantic dual-PhD candidate in Informatics at UIUC, with a focus on art, design-technics, and 20th century cultural heritage. Experienced game developer, multi-media designer, and researcher in real-time visualisation. Currently developing technical infrastructure to support interpretation, participation, and creativity in spatial representation and research - specifically towards understanding perceptions of modern architectural heritage.</p> -->
<!-- <p>
    Transatlantic dual-PhD candidate at UIUC, I integrate Informatics with the critical study of 20th-century cultural heritage. Specialising in game development and multimedia design, with an emphasis on real-time visualisation, I design software infrastructure to support interaction, interpretation, and participatory engagement in spatial research. My research develops novel methodologies to model public perceptions of modern architectural heritage through cutting-edge computational and visualisation techniques. This research contributes to the Architectural Digital Humanities and is theoretically situated within Stiegler's framework of mnemotechnical systems.

    As a Transatlantic dual-PhD candidate at UIUC, I synthesise Informatics with the study of 20th-century cultural heritage. I build software to bring new interactive, interpretive, and participatory capacities to "spatial research" using Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Virtual Enivronments. These technologies dovetail into a new expansive methodology for the Architectural Digital Humanities, where the scholarly creation of virtual environments can become participatory research venues during exhibition -- collecting and integrating perceptions, stories, and additional media. My research is theoretically grounded by Bernard Stiegler's notion of mnemotechnical systems, which advocates for the total design of memory infrastructure: combining data management, expressive interfaces, and social practices for maintenance.

    As a dual-PhD candidate at UIUC and the Cyprus Institute, my work bridges Informatics with 20th-century cultural heritage studies, focusing on the development of software that enhances spatial research through interactive, interpretive, and participatory interfaces. Leveraging Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Virtual Environments (VEs), my research contributes to a novel unified methodology in Architectural Digital Humanities. This approach transforms scholarly virtual environments into active participatory research platforms, particularly during museum exhibitions, turning them into tools for collecting and integrating public-contributed insights, stories, and media. A key theoretical underpinning of my research is Bernard Stieglerâ€™s concept of mnemotechnical systems, which advocates for a holistic view of memory infrastructure, merging social practices with technological frameworks to support collective memory.
