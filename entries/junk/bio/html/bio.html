<!-- <p>
    Transatlantic dual-PhD candidate at UIUC, I integrate Informatics with the critical study of 20th-century cultural heritage. Specialising in game development and multimedia design, with an emphasis on real-time visualisation, I design software infrastructure to support interaction, interpretation, and participatory engagement in spatial research. My research develops novel methodologies to model public perceptions of modern architectural heritage through cutting-edge computational and visualisation techniques. This research contributes to the Architectural Digital Humanities and is theoretically situated within Stiegler's framework of mnemotechnical systems.

    A Transatlantic dual-PhD candidate at UIUC, I synthesise Informatics with the critical study of 20th-century cultural heritage. My specialisation in game development and multimedia design, emphasising real-time visualisation, leads to crafting software infrastructures pivotal for interactive, interpretive, and participatory aspects of spatial research. I am at the forefront of developing methodologies to model public perceptions of modern architectural heritage, employing state-of-the-art computational and visualisation techniques. Contributing significantly to the Architectural Digital Humanities, my research is theoretically anchored in Stiegler's mnemotechnical systems, aiming to redefine public engagement with heritage in the digital era.
